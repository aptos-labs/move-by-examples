## Env setup

This code is deprecated, see the [latest version in create-aptos-dapp](https://github.com/aptos-labs/create-aptos-dapp/tree/main/examples/aptos-friend).

Check out the guide from [Aptos Learn](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/example/aptogotchi-beginner/env-setup).

## Play with testnet deployments on explorer

Go to testnet explorer [here](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/?network=testnet) and search for the contract address.

You can find the contract address in each contract directory's `contract_address.txt`.

On explorer, you can read the contract code, call entry functions (need to connect wallet), and call view functions.

## Development

In each contract's `move` directory, you can run below commands.

Run unit test

```sh
./sh_scripts/test.sh
```

Deploy to testnet

```sh
./sh_scripts/deploy.sh
```

Upgrade deployed contract

```sh
./sh_scripts/upgrade.sh
```

Run Move scripts. Move scripts are off-chain Move functions that let you call multiple functions atomically, it's similar to how you group multiple instructions in 1 transaction on Solana.

```sh
# You can explorer what other scripts are available in sh_scripts
./sh_scripts/create_and_mint_some_fas.sh
```
