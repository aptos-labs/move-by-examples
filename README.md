# Move by Examples

This repo contains a list of Move examples built on Aptos. Some of the examples are accompanied by a Solana version or a Solidity Version to help developers from other ecosystems have a better comparison. Check out each example's readme for more details.

We also have [Aptos Learn](https://learn.aptoslabs.com) which contains an overview of Aptos and Move and more step-by-step tutorials.

So far we have covered topics like

- Create a single contract app.
- Define custom data structures.
- Define read and write endpoints for your contract.
- Emit event.
- Create a token (both FT and NFT).
- Transfer token.
- Cross-contract call.
- Write unit test.
- Deploy contract to testnet.
- Upgrade deployed contract.
- Create a Move script to atomically call multiple functions in 1 tx.
- Interact with the contract using TypeScript SDK.
- Using Dispatchable Fungible Asset standard to impose a tax on buy/sell from a dex pool.
